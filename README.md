# 🧐 What's the stack?
- Frontend: Basic HTML, CSS & JavaScript. I have used jQuery & Bootstrap for keeping the library simple and responsive.
- Backend: Node.js & Express.js for creating new routes, handling GET and POST requests, and performing CRUD operations on databases.
- Database: I have used MongoDB Atlas for remote database, and Mongoose for modelling the application data.
- Two schemas & collections, one for data of users, and another for public library.
